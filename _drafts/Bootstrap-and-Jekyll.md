Recently I discovered github pages, a friend at university mentioned it a 
couple months ago actually but I was pretty busy with my 
[final year project]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2019-01-25-Final-Year-Project %}), 
so only in the last couple weeks have I had the time to play around with 
it. It's clearly designed for static pages as is explained on the github 
pages [homepage](https://pages.github.com/), and while I've had a brief 
encounter with dynamic web apps during my internship at 
[Telstra](https://kcexn.github.io/#work-header) I've never dabbled with 
static pages before. At this stage in my life, I don't see myself as the 
worlds best web developer, but I thought this is probably a skill worth 
learning. So I started by learning the front-end CSS framework 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), and in developing this blog I 
found Jekyll through the github pages documentation.

I have in the past considered learning HTML and CSS, but usually lack the 
right motivating project to learn. In addition, I typically find the 
experience of typing up HTML generally to be a fairly excruciatingly 
dull process. With the recent completion of my degree, I felt that a good 
way to keep learning and developing myself was to have a place where I 
can write about personal and work projects. And right now over my summer 
break seems like the perfect time to setup this blog and learn some things 
about HTML and CSS.
