Recently I discovered github pages, a friend at university mentioned it a 
couple months ago actually but I was pretty busy with my 
[final year project]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% post_url 2019-01-25-Final-Year-Project %}), 
so only in the last couple weeks have I had the time to play around with 
it. It's clearly designed for static pages as is explained on the github 
pages [homepage](https://pages.github.com/), and while I've had a brief 
encounter with dynamic web apps during my internship at 
[Telstra](https://kcexn.github.io/#work-header) I've never dabbled with 
static pages before. At this stage in my life, I don't see myself as the 
worlds best web developer, but I thought this is probably a skill worth 
learning. So I started by learning the front-end CSS framework 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), and in developing this blog I 
found Jekyll through the github pages documentation.

I have in the past considered learning HTML and CSS, but usually lack the 
right motivating project to learn. In addition, I typically find the 
experience of typing up HTML generally to be a fairly excruciatingly 
dull process. With the recent completion of my degree, I felt that a good 
way to keep learning and developing myself was to have a place where I 
can write about personal and work projects. And right now over my summer 
break seems like the perfect time to setup this blog and learn some things 
about HTML and CSS.

## Bootstrap

I think the ideal way to approach learning web development should have 
been to learn HTML5, CSS and Javascript from scratch so that I developed 
a strong sense of the fundamentals of the web tools. However, I felt like 
hitting the ground running with building a webpage, my previous experience 
with front end web development has been that web development is most fun 
when just trying things, since adding nice looking elements to the page 
is quick and easy, and there's a fun rush of instant gratification. Also 
I felt a bit like I'd just spent 4 years in a degree doing study from 
first principles and it's nice to just hack something together sometimes. 
These feelings led me to the Bootstrap CSS framework. 

The Bootstrap framework offers a lot of pre-existing elements that can 
just be used, buttons, nav-bars, fonts etc. This really sped up my 
experience of building this site, since I didn't need to spend as much 
time figuring out how to actually style things and can focus just on 
placing elements on the page. I really like the fact that Bootstrap 
offered mobile compatibility out of the box.

A major downside is that since Bootstrap is so easy to use, with many 
pre-existing classes that can just be plugged in where you want them. I 
had no need to learn CSS properly, and just blurrily hacked my way through 
any additional CSS that I needed based on a combination of my intuition 
(read: educated guesses about how CSS might work) and random stack 
overflow posts.
