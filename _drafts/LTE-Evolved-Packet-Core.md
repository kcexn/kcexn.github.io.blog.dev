# The Evolved Packet Core

I recently started this new job as an integration engineer at Ericsson. 
It's an exciting first step in my career after my Bachelors degree 
. I'm working in LTE packet core and am a 
big believer in the benefits of the [Feynman technique](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772) when it comes to 
learning. As such I'm going to try and write about as much of the learning 
as possible here in the hopes that it both cements the knowledge in my 
own brain, documents the things that I have learned throughout my work, 
and maybe even provide a useful reference for me to look back on in the 
future.

# Packet Core Architecture

I have had some exposure to the packet core at university in wireless 
communications and IP networking subjects, but none that really required 
me to dig deep into its inner workings and architecture. As I really 
haven't been here very long, and it's always best to start with a high 
level view of things before diving into any specific component. I think it 
will be a good idea to examine the overall architecture of the LTE 
evolved packet core.
